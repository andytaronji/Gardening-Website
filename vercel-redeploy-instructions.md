# Redeploying Your Gardening Website to Vercel

Now that we've updated the GitHub repository to include the actual image files (instead of Git LFS pointers), you can redeploy your website to Vercel. Here are the steps:

## Option 1: Automatic Redeployment (If GitHub Integration is Set Up)

If you've set up your Vercel project to automatically deploy from GitHub:

1. The changes we just pushed should trigger an automatic redeployment
2. Go to your Vercel dashboard (https://vercel.com/dashboard)
3. Select your project
4. Check the "Deployments" tab to see if a new deployment is in progress
5. If not, you can manually trigger a deployment by clicking the "Redeploy" button

## Option 2: Manual Redeployment

If you prefer to manually redeploy:

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard (https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Click the "Deployments" tab
4. Click the "Redeploy" button next to your latest deployment
5. Select "Redeploy from GitHub" to pull the latest changes

## Option 3: Deploy from Local Files

If you're having issues with the GitHub integration:

1. Run the `prepare-for-vercel-with-images.bat` script (or the PowerShell script)
2. Go to your Vercel dashboard
3. Click "Add New..." â†’ "Project"
4. Select "Upload"
5. Drag and drop the generated zip file (`gardening-platform-for-vercel.zip`)
6. Configure with the same settings as your previous deployment
7. Click "Deploy"

## Verifying the Deployment

After redeployment:

1. Wait for the deployment to complete
2. Click on the deployment URL to open your website
3. Verify that all images are now displaying correctly

## Future Updates

For future updates:

1. Make your changes to the code
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. Vercel should automatically redeploy (if GitHub integration is set up)
4. If not, follow the manual redeployment steps above

The changes we've made ensure that all images will be properly included in your Vercel deployments going forward.
